Examples of primary microplastics include exfoliating microbeads found in body scrubs or toothpaste. Secondary microplastics originate from larger objects that have broken down.<\/p><p>Secondary microplastics derive from typical plastic goods - most commonly trash bags, Ziploc bags, plastic water bottles, packaging, and fishing nets.

Here’s what you need to know.<\/p><p><strong>Microplastic Pollution and the Planet<\/strong><\/p><p>Microplastic pollution is most common in marine environments. Water erodes plastic, causing it to break down into these tiny shards. At the same time, being in open water allows for UV rays from the sun to penetrate the plastic, breaking it down further. <\/p><p><br\/>You may not see these tiny bits of plastic, but they have a lingering effect on wildlife. First, microplastics accumulate in the ocean and are consumed by tiny organisms. Then, as larger animals feed on small organisms, microplastics move up the food chain. <\/p><p>Microplastic pollution is so prevalent that in a recent study of fish's gut, fillet, and livers, <a href=\"https:\/\/oceanconservancy.org\/blog\/2021\/10\/18\/eating-microplastics\/#:~:text=Previous%20research%20has%20suggested%20that,of%20the%20three%20studied%20tissues.\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">99% contained microplastic <\/span><\/a>particles in at least one of the three tissues.

Another leading cause of microplastic consumption is bottled water. A staggering <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/niallmccarthy\/2018\/03\/16\/study-finds-microplastics-in-93-percent-of-bottled-water-infographic\/?sh=46aca26c73fa\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">93% of bottled water<\/span><\/a> sampled worldwide contain microplastic particles, and US tap water also contains large amounts of microplastic debris. <br\/><br\/>In addition to microplastics in our food and drinking water, you could be breathing in microplastics.

In 2022, scientists published new findings that microplastics have been found <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0048969722020009\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">in human lung tissue<\/span><\/a> for the first time ever.<\/p><p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0160412022001258\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">2022 study<\/span><\/a> found microplastics in the human bloodstream for the first time, with microplastics found in almost 80% of participants. What effect does microplastic have on our bodies? Well, while long-term studies have not been conducted on the effects of microplastics on the body, it can be assumed that this pollution is harmful to human health. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.news-medical.net\/health\/How-do-Microplastics-Affect-Our-Health.aspx\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Scientists have observed <\/span><\/a>metabolic and hormonal disturbances from microplastics, which may lead to weight gain and hormonal issues.

Through small, everyday choices, you can decrease the amount of microplastic particles in the environment and lessen the impact of existing microplastics on your health.<\/p><p>To reduce plastic pollution dramatically, opt for reusable products whenever possible. Switching to refillable glass or metal water bottles instead of plastic bottled water will keep more single-use plastic out of landfills and minimize the amount of microplastics you consume. In addition to reusable water bottles, consider switching to reusable shopping bags, food containers, and refillable cleaning products when possible to cut back on plastic water.<\/p><p>When reusable just isn’t an option (helloooo, trash bags and sandwich bags!), choose a compostable option that breaks down cleanly without creating microplastics. HoldOn compostable trash bags are plant-based and nontoxic, meaning that they will break down cleanly into planet-friendly material without producing plastic residue. <\/p>"
